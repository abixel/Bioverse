``Bioverse`` can be split into three primary components:

- The first module combines planet occurrence rates with empirical and hypothetical relationships between planet properties to produce a statistically realistic simulation of planetary systems in the solar neighborhood.

- The second module simulates a dataset (with uncertainties) that might be produced by an extensive direct imaging or transit spectroscopy survey of this exoplanet population.

- The third module applies statistical hypothesis tests to the simulated dataset in an attempt to uncover statistical relationships injected by the first module.

By iterating over these three modules as shown below, ``Bioverse`` can evaluate the potential of next-generation exoplanet surveys to answer key questions about exoplanet statistics.
